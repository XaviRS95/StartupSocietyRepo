    <p>Student society for people interested in tech startups and building them in the future!</p>
    <p>We are a group of MTU Cork students passionate about startups. This society is for you, if you are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Interested in startups</li>
        <li>Would like to know how to build your own startup in the future</li>
        <li>Would like to work at startup in the future</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What are we planning to do as a society?<p>

    <p>1. Lectures</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lectures:</li>
        <p>
            invited to share ideas, teach and inspire students as well

            as open them up to possible career choices in the tech

            start-up industry or to work on their start-ups</p>

    </ul>




        2. Workshops

        Activities run by professionals working at start-ups, with a

        group of students to improve their skillset.


        3. Company visits

        We give students the opportunity to see how tech start-

        ups operate internally. This benefits the company too by

        increasing their exposure to students which attracts

        young talent.


        4. Brainstorming sessions

        Sessions where students are welcomed to discuss with

        each other all the building tech startup-related topics
